Multi-Master Replication Algorithm

Single-master replication has some limitations in terms of performance, scalability, and availability.
there are many applications where availability and performance are much more important than data consistency or transactional semantics.
Multi-master replication is an alternative replication technique that favors higher availability and performance over data consistency.

This technique is also known as multi-primary replication.

In this technique, all replicas are equal and can accept write requests. 
They are also responsible for propagating the data modifications to the rest of the group.

Nodes might disagree on what is the right order for some requests. We usually refer to this as a conflict.



Conflict resolution

An important aspect of different approaches to resolving conflicts is whether they do it eagerly or lazily.

In the eagerly case, the conflict is resolved during the write operation.

In the lazily case, the write operation proceeds to maintain multiple, alternative versions of the data record that are eventually resolved to a single version later on, i.e., during a subsequent read operation.

Approaches to conflict resolution

Exposing conflict resolution to the clients
- Client selects which data to prefer in case of Conflict

Last-write-wins conflict resolution
-Each node in the system tags each version with a timestamp, using a local clock. During a conflict, the version with the latest timestamp is selected.

Causality tracking algorithms
-The system uses an algorithm that keeps track of causal relationships between different requests. 
When there is a conflict between two writes (A, B) and one is determined to be the cause of the other one (suppose A is the cause of B), then the resulting write (B) is retained.

However, there can still be writes that are not causally related, i.e., requests are actually concurrent. 
In such cases, the system cannot make an easy decision.
