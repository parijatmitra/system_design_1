Quorums in Distributed Systems

concept of quorums  how they solve low availability problems in synchronous replication.

The problem in synchronous replication
-Availability is quite low for write operations, because the failure of a single node makes the system unable to process writes until the node recovers.

Quorums

A past paper introduced this technique as a quorum-based voting protocol for replica control.

In general, in a system that has a total of 
V replicas, every read operation should obtain a read quorum of 
Vr replicas. Meanwhile, a write operation should obtain a write quorum of 
Vw replicas. The values of these quorums should obey the following properties:

Vr + Vw > V --Important
Vw > V/2 --Important

The first rule ensures that a data item is not read and written by two operations concurrently.

The second rule ensures that at least one node receives both of the two write operations and imposes an order on them. 
This means that two write operations from two different operations cannot occur concurrently on the same data item.

Both of the rules together guarantee that the associated distributed database behaves as a centralized, one-replica database system.

The concept of a quorum is really useful in distributed systems that have multiple nodes.

The concept of a quorum is used extensively in other areas, like distributed transactions or consensus protocols.
