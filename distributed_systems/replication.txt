The technique we use to achieve availability is replication.

Availability

Availability refers to the ability of the system to remain functional despite failures in parts of it.

Mechanism to achieve availability

The technique we use to achieve availability is replication.

Replication

Replication is the main technique used in distributed systems to increase availability. 
It consists of storing the same piece of data in multiple nodes (called replicas) so that if one of them crashes, 
data is not lost, and requests can be served from the other nodes in the meanwhile.

These copies must be maintained and kept in sync with each other on every update.


There are two main strategies for replication:

Pessimistic replication
Optimistic replication

Pessimistic replication

Pessimistic replication tries to guarantee from the beginning that all the replicas are identical to each other 
as if there was only one copy of the data all along.

Optimistic replication

Optimistic replication, or lazy replication, allows the different replicas to diverge. 
This guarantees that they will converge again if the system does not receive any updates, or enters a quiesced state, for a period of time.
