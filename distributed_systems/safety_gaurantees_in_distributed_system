let's explore the properties that guarantee safety in distributed systems, and their relation with difficulties in designing distributed systems.

Property           Property which is harming that property

Atomicity          Partial failures
Consistency        Network asynchrony
Isolation          Concurrency

Partial failures reduce atomicity.
Network asynchrony reduces consistency.
Concurrency reduces isolation.
